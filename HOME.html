I believe that we are who we choose to be. 
Nobody s going to come and save you, you have got to save yourself.
Nobody s going to give you anything. You have got to go out and fight for it.
Nobody knows what you want except for you. 
And nobody will be as sorry as you if you don't get it. 
So do not give up on your dreams.

<h2>
<i>We have all been lost for most of this life
Everywhere we turn more hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of us just ain t right
Following the wrong steps being led by pride.</i>

<h3>
I was never one to patiently pick up broken fragments and glue 
them together again and tell myself that the mending whole was good as new.
What is broken is broken and I did rather remember 
it as it was at its best than mend it and see the broken places as long as I 
lived.
